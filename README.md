# Snake Game

This is a basic implementation of the classic **Snake Game** as a console application written in **C#**. It is developed using the **.NET Framework 4.8**.

---

## Attention

If you're using **Windows 11** or the new **Windows Terminal**, you need to set your default terminal application to **Windows Console Host**. Alternatively, you can open **Command Prompt**, navigate to the app directory, and run `Snake Game.exe` directly.
